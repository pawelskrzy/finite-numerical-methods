Computational simulation: Finite-difference numerical methods (Explicit Euler, leapfrog, 4th order Runge-Kutta and implicit Euler) used to solve the differential equation for pendulum systems

Report Introduction:

Numerical methods can be used to solve first-order differential equations that cannot be solved explicitly. These methods are based on finite approximations of derivatives, and discrete solutions can be generated computationally. However, since these are approximate, they can deviate from the exact solution with its degree depending on the method and the step size used. In this report, different methods are used to solve the differential equations that describe the motion of a single pendulum, and are compared to one another. The most accurate and stable method is then used to analyse the double pendulum system under varying parameters.

Report abstract:

Finite-difference numerical methods (Explicit Euler, leapfrog, 4th order Runge-Kutta and implicit Euler) were used to solve the differential equation for a single pendulum system to test the accuracy and stability of each method. The Runge-Kutta method was found to be the most accurate and stable, which was then used to study the motion of a double pendulum system. The dynamics of the systems and the effectiveness of the methods used are discussed.
